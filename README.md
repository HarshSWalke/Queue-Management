## 🧩 Overview

**SmartQueue** is an intelligent queue management system built in **Python** with a clean and easy-to-use **Streamlit** interface.  
It is designed to efficiently handle real-world queue problems — like managing customer flow at hospitals, salons, government offices, or cafeterias — using core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts such as Queues, Priority Queues, Stacks, Sorting, and Searching.

This project demonstrates how **DSA principles** can be applied to a **practical, daily-life application** and provides an interactive platform where customers and administrators can view, manage, and optimize service queues.

## 🚀 Key Features

| Functionality | Description | DSA Concept Used |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Add Customer to Queue** | Add a new customer (Normal / VIP / Emergency) | Queue + Priority Queue |
| **Serve Next Customer** | Serve customers in correct order of priority | Dequeue + Stack (for undo) |
| **Undo Last Served** | Undo a mistakenly served customer | Stack |
| **Search Customer** | Find position or details of a specific customer | Linear / Binary Search |
| **Estimate Wait Time** | Calculate estimated waiting time for each user | Queue Traversal |
| **View Analytics** | Display metrics like avg wait time, total served | Graphs / Lists |
| **Persistent Data** | (Optional) Save and reload queue states | File Handling |

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Languages & Frameworks:**
- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit (Frontend)

**Libraries Used:**
- `pandas` – data handling  
- `numpy` – calculations  
- `matplotlib` – analytics and graphs  
- `streamlit` – UI framework  
- *(Optional)* `seaborn` – for enhanced visualization

## 🧠 System Design

**Logical Flow:**
1. Users join a queue with their name and type (Normal, VIP, or Emergency).  
2. Queue is maintained using a **priority-based system** — Emergency > VIP > Normal.  
3. Admin can serve, undo, or view the queue.  
4. Real-time updates are reflected on the Streamlit dashboard.  
5. Analytics tab shows service statistics and performance insights.

**Core DSA Components:**
- **Queue:** Customer line representation  
- **Priority Queue:** Managing different service priorities  
- **Stack:** Undo last operation  
- **Search & Sorting:** For lookup and reporting  
- **Linked List / List:** Data traversal and display
